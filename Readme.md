## ðŸŽ“ How to Run

### Backend

```bash
cd backend
npm install
node index.js
```

Make sure PostgreSQL is set up and configured with a `bookings` table:

```sql
CREATE TABLE bookings (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  userId TEXT NOT NULL,
  startTime TIMESTAMP NOT NULL,
  endTime TIMESTAMP NOT NULL
);
```

### Frontend

```bash
cd frontend
flutter pub get
flutter run
```

Make sure the base URL in your Flutter app matches the backend server IP.
